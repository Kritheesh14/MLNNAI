# MLNNAI

Learning Artificial Intelligence step by step â€” from **fundamental models** to **neural networks**.  
This repository showcases experiments and notebooks created while building a strong foundation in Machine Learning.  

---
- Implemented **Linear Regression** from scratch.  
- Explored **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)** and its behavior with different `k` values.
